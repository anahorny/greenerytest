Dimanche is open source and freeware test automation framework built upon Watir Webdriver and Cucumber.

The main goal of the framework is to speed-up scripts creation and decrease time for maintenance.

Main features implemented in the framework:

    In most cases you don't need to write Ruby code, only plain-text Cucumber scenarios, the framework will generate the code auto-magically if you follow the patterns.
    Structured XML file with object declarations is easy to fill and maintain.
    You don't have to set fixed time intervals to wait until some AJAX control appears on the page, the framework has a reliable mechanism to handle such situations.
